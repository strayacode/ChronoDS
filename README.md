# yuugen
A DS Emulator written in C++

Motivation:
. It's formed my childhood nostalgia
. I will learn many new concepts (c++ related, scheduler, fastmem, JIT, 3d graphics, qt, etc...)
. preserve the ds hardware to my best ability so it can be played for generations to come
. create an amazing emulator one day rival MelonDS
. create a piece of software with no rush and for me to fully understand everything going on

some plans:
. have 2 repos for yuugen. one solely focused on accuracy while the other being accurate enough to play games while having great performance
. main frontend being qt while minimal frontend is sdl
. hardware test, hardware test, hardware test
. never make assumptions
. add controller support with sdl stuff
. properly implement the qt frontend by learning qt first
. add dma transfers
